# ⚽ Football Oracle AI – Player Valuation & Scouting System

Football Oracle AI is a machine learning–driven application designed to predict football player market values and support scouting analysis.  
The system uses structured player attributes (age, overall rating, potential, position, league context) to estimate market valuation and includes an interactive Gradio UI for real-time player analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a complete end-to-end valuation pipeline:

- ✔ Preprocess the **footballData.csv** dataset from Kaggle  
- ✔ Train a neural network to predict log-transformed player value  
- ✔ Deploy an interactive **Gradio web app**  
- ✔ Provide AI-powered scouting feedback  
- ✔ Allow manual custom player valuation  
- ✔ Display similar players and analysis insights  

This repository contains the notebook (`.ipynb`) used to train the model and run the Gradio interface.
